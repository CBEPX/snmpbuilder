Status: Updating for 2.2.6
Known Issues: Items not being saved to template.

Snmpbuilder is an addon for zabbix to help users use SNMP OIDS as zabbix items (data sources)

This tool was originaly written by giapnguyen (see https://github.com/giapnguyen/snmpbuilder)
Later Sire adopted it for zabbix-2.0.0 and atimonin for zabbox-2.0.5

from original README (from giapnguen):

	I write the tool because I'm tired in create SNMP items for zabbix.
	To create a useful zabbix's template for SNMP devices, I used to open a MIB
	browser to get correct OID then fill the zabbix's item forms.
	It'm so boring when create a long list of items :-( .
	There is a first attempt of work out this problem, zload_snmpwalk
	http://zabbix.com/wiki/howto/monitor/snmp/zload_snmpwalk.
	But I rather a GUI tool. So why just make one?

	SNMP builder is a add-in for Zabbix. It provide browse MIB for values and
	informations, automatically convert into Zabbix items and insert them
	into a template.

Installation:

Prerequisits: install snmp packet from your repo (RHEL: yum install net-snmp-utils)
Copy contents of zabbix folder into your web zabbix folder.

How to use:

In configuration mode yow should have "SNMP Builder" submenu, go there

Fill in: Host (ip address), Community.
Select MIB from dropdown list (for ex IF-MIB).
You should see MIB subtree on the left.
Click some leaf or table in subthee (for ex ifTable or sysUpTime).
Now you shoud see SNMP data in "OID Data" table and some description
 in "Information" window.
Select the data you need in "OID Data" table, you'll see it's added as zabbix
 item in "Item list" table. You may select multiple. To remove item click on it in
 "Item list"
To save items, select template from dropdown list and click save.
You may also check "Create graph" checkbox to add grafs of all items you selected.

Happy SNMPing!
